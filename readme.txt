1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
- 2/4 Identifying the most popular activities
- 2.8/3 Adding a text earch interface

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I would say this assignment took longer than A1, which is about 15 hours.

3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)

I used W3 schools to find other string methods that I might find useful.

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

Much of the assignment was done on my own, so I did not consult other people.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

My implementation of the searching function may be very slow, sometimes to the point that the page freezes, which is more apparent if I include a clickable link for each tweet (that part of the code is commented out). I'm certain the search can be better optimized, but I don't know how exactly I can do that with the activities I've found. Another thing about the search: there may be few tweets where the activity doesn't reflect what's written, and I have no idea why. In case I didn't fully implement the Vega-Lite graphs before the deadline, I have managed to extract the activity type and distance from the tweets.
